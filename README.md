## Pictures of Progress

I regret deleting the other pictures I had saved, but just to sum it up I figured out how to get groups to follow leaders in different formations around a perfect spherical planet. I also figured out how to get RTS selections working while panning around the perfect spherical planet. E.g. select units and tell them to move, when you select a group of units a random unit in that group is chosen to be the leader and everyone follows the leader in a specific formation.
